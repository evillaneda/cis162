        <h1>Eric Villaneda</h1>
            <p>Hello my name is Eric and I am 22 years old.
                 I have been on and off cerritos for a short time as a part time student.
                 However now that I have a stable job and income as well as schedule I plan to finish my AA in computer science. 
                 I have 5 dogs and love to play video games as well as go to the gym. 
                 Fun fact, I have lived in LA my whole life and have only been outside of California a few times.</p>
        <h1>Hobbies on my free time</h1>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I like to start my day with a workout followed by a good meal because that determines how your day will flow.</li>
                    <li>Second, I like to go sight seeing and crusing preferably with friends. It is a great stress reliever to also have a healthy disconnect from social media and be one with nature.</li>
                    <li>My third hobby is late night gaming with friends, its a good way to end my day and recharge for school or work the next day.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>My Favorite we site is <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube.com</a> because you can find videos on anything which I generally use for educational andd informative things like servicing my car or adding modifications or video game puzzle tutorials to name a few.</p>
